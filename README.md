# My-Intents
Intents helps us to move one application to the another application:smile:
Implicit and explicit intents.Implicit intents are used for to move one application to another application.Explicit intents are used to move one activity to another acitivity.:laughing: 
In this application i used implicit intents to share the information,
and  navigate to the maps from this application,
and navigate to the calls.:calling:
We use the intents in all aplications where we have to move one from one.:smile:
